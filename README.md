Full stack application utilizing Google Authentication, Chat GPT-4, and Prisma Postgres APIs.  

The application prompts the user for sign in via Google, unless they already have an account.
The user is then logged in where they are asked what their favorite movie is.
In the next page the user can then see their name, google profile picture, and a random movie fact about their favorite movie generated by ChatGPT.
Every time the page reloads the fact changes and the AI will come up with a new movie fact.
The user can then log out, and if they go to the link that was used for the signed in page, they will be prompted an error.
